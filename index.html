					<font size="5">
					My passion is games: card, board, sport, hand, and video. I enjoy pop culture, observing concept art, and hearing all kinds of storiesâ€”legends, history, fairytales, novels, etc. My work is an interpretation and representation of my passion and everything that I define as magnificent. It is a reflection of my commitment and dedication to game design, as well as conceptual design, and, above all, my drive to create unique combinations of art and programming. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Video games invite a type of participation that exceeds most interactive artworks. They possess the qualities of storytelling, visual aesthetics, and the profundity of amusement. Which is why my career goal is to work in game design. I want to create worlds and convey stories of my own; something unique that I can give to everyone. Something fun and interactive, yet compelling and worthwhile. I continue to collect more knowledge pertaining to the arts and programming all in pursuit of becoming a professional game designer.
